# ATB12x API Automation Programs

Welcome to the **ATB12x API Automation Programs** repository! This project is designed to help you learn and master API automation using **Rest Assured**, along with modern testing practices, robust reporting, and data-driven strategies.

## Overview

This repository provides hands-on programs progressing from the basics of Rest Assured to advanced concepts, including:

- Learning the fundamentals of **Rest Assured**
- All major HTTP methods: **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, **PATCH**, and **DELETE**
- Full coverage of **CRUD operations**
- Enhanced test management and reporting tools


## What You'll Learn

- **REST Assured Basics:** Creating and validating API requests and responses.
- **CRUD Operations:** Implementing comprehensive Create, Read, Update, Delete workflows.
- **TestNG Integration:** Using TestNG for structured, scalable automated testing.
- **Allure Reports:** Automatically generating rich, informative test reports.
- **Data-driven Testing:** Leveraging Apache APIs to run tests with external data sources.
